 The reason I want to have a career in Software Engineering is that it's exciting to be able to solve problems and make things fun and easy for other people to enjoy and learn from. Whenever I see a new app or a new appliance I'm in awe of the minds that could have thought of the blueprint or the code to make it. I want to create a code of something so amazing that people are mindblown by it the same way I am. This First Mile has been a humbling experience for me because I struggled to grasp some information.  I found myself having a little bit of imposter syndrome during this process but after my first pod meeting, I felt relieved that others were feeling the same as me. I realized it's okay not to understand information right away.Whenever I had a moment of understanding I would have a break just to have a little celebration for myself to keep me motivated. I know if I keep this positive mindset and determination to not give up I will become an amazing Software Engineer.
